(If it's possible to check this tomorrow, I could try adding a sound effects menu and animations, sorry ðŸ¥º)

Iâ€™ve created a 'cookie clicker' game where users can click on a cookie to earn cookies and purchase upgrades to increase the number of cookies they earn per click and per second! I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the Fetch API, Local Storage, and setInterval.

Rendering the upgrades was quite challenging because I needed to ensure they appeared correctly on the page and updated as expected. The DOM part, in particular, was tricky, but this article https://medium.com/@ecastille924/javascript-example-rendering-some-data-to-the-dom-with-fetch-27d4d3316db7 was helpful.

Regarding a fairly simple issue, I still donâ€™t quite understand why my main cookie image is still in a frame (or whatever it is?) even though I set the background to transparent and removed the border in style.css. I assume something else is causing this, but I canâ€™t figure out what??
